- The app should be built as a Single Page Application in vue.js.

- It is enough to target the newest version of chrome.

- The employer enters how much she is willing to pay maximally. The employee enters how much he expects to be paid minimally. As soon as both inputs have been submitted, a modal window pops up and shows either “Success!” or “Failure!”, as well as the entered values. “Success” is only if the employee’s minimum pay is equal to or below the employer’s maximum pay. Otherwise the input is considered a “Failure”.

- The interface of the app consists of two tabs: one for the employee and one for the employer. Each tab contains an input box which only accepts numbers, and a “Submit” button. Once a value has been entered and submitted, the input field of the tab disappears.
